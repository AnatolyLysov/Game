<!-- Based on the provided query "fix problem with #include <gtk/gtk.h>" and the context files, I'll analyze the GTK-related header inclusion and provide appropriate fixes.

The context shows two files using GTK:
1. /home/aikidance/Game/dir1/main.c
2. /home/aikidance/Game/dir2/main.c

Both files include GTK headers, but dir2/main.c has additional OpenGL-related headers. The issue might be related to missing GTK development packages or incorrect include paths.

Here's the recommended solution:

1. For /home/aikidance/Game/dir1/main.c:

Line and Column Explanation:
- The context shows the file starting at line 1, column 0
- The GTK include is at line 1, column 0
- We'll add pkg-config include directive as a comment and ensure proper header inclusion

```c
||| /home/aikidance/Game/dir1/main.c | 1:0-2:0 |||
// Compile with: `pkg-config --cflags gtk+-3.0`
#include <gtk/gtk.h>

```

2. For /home/aikidance/Game/dir2/main.c:

Line and Column Explanation:
- The context shows the file starting at line 1, column 0
- The GTK include is at line 3, after OpenGL headers
- We'll reorganize headers and add compilation instructions

```c
||| /home/aikidance/Game/dir2/main.c | 1:0-4:0 |||
// Compile with: `pkg-config --cflags gtk+-3.0 epoxy`
#include <gtk/gtk.h>
#include <epoxy/gl.h>
#include <epoxy/glx.h>

```

Explanation of changes:
1. Added compilation instructions as comments showing the required pkg-config command
2. For dir2/main.c, reordered headers to put GTK first (as it's a higher-level framework)
3. Both changes ensure proper header inclusion and provide clear build instructions

To fully resolve the GTK header inclusion issue:

1. Ensure GTK3 development packages are installed:
   ```bash
   # For Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt-get install libgtk-3-dev
   # For Fedora
   sudo dnf install gtk3-devel
   ```

2. Compile the programs using pkg-config:
   ```bash
   # For dir1/main.c
   gcc $(pkg-config --cflags --libs gtk+-3.0) main.c -o program

   # For dir2/main.c
   gcc $(pkg-config --cflags --libs gtk+-3.0 epoxy) main.c -o program
   ```

These changes ensure proper header inclusion and provide clear build instructions while maintaining the functionality of both programs. -->
